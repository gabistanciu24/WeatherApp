# Daily Weather

The weather application made with Vue is designed to display weather information for multiple cities. It features a city grid that allows users to quickly access weather details for their favorite locations. Additionally, the app has the ability to detect the user's current location and display the corresponding city in the grid.

As for future developments, the app is set to include more customization options, such as the ability to switch between different themes and styles. Furthermore, the app will incorporate more detailed weather information, including a 24-hour and 7-day forecast on each page with a path for them.

With its intuitive design and robust features, this Vue-based weather app is the perfect solution for users looking to stay up-to-date with the latest weather conditions in multiple locations.
